        I've chosen a career in web development, I love the challenge of solving problems and the satisfaction that comes with creating something that is useful to others. I also enjoy the creative aspects of web development, such as designing user interfaces and coming up with innovative solutions to problems.
        I also like spending time with my five lovely dogs and also play video games, and being up to date with new game launching:
